# care_pathway
This is part of the project Care pathway extraction from claim data at CZ that can be published

The main motivation for setting up the project is to use the big volume of CZ claim data (250
million claims per year) as a main pillar for designing a software artifact. This artifact should
lead to answers to certain business questions set by the company, through the usage of data and
data science techniques. In terms of this, the long term goal iss defined, in light of which this
project is executed. This goal is to get insights from the health insurance data that CZ owns, so
that the companyâ€™s internal processes are notably improved, a significant cost reduction can be
achieved, and the utilities that are offered to CZ clients enhanced.
